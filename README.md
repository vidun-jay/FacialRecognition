# FacialRecognition
Facial-recognition through webcam using opencv.

## Prerequisites
Needs `python` and `pip` to be installed.

## Installation/Usage (macOS/Linux)
Needs to be run through the virtual python environment:

cd into the FacialRecognition directory

```$ cd /Path/to/FacialRecognition```

Run the script through the python venv

```$ venv/bin/python main.py```

## Troubleshooting
Program _should_ run out of the box, but if it doesn't you're probably missing some libraries. From the FacialRecognition directory, run

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

and try again.
